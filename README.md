# Time Series Project

This project was created to learn about time series. I am taking a public dataset called [Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/overview) The dataset was put together by [Corporación Favorita](https://www.corporacionfavorita.com/) an Ecuatorian chain of grocery stores.

**Goal:** Our initial goal for this project was to see if we can accurately forecast sales across the existing family of products for our selected store.
